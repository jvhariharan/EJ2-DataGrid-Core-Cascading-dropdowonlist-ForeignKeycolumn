Cascading dropdownlist bind in ForeignKey column

<>I252475- Cascading dropdownlist bind in ForeignKey column 

By default, foreign key column is used to map the two tables and based on the field value we have mapped another table(foreign key field value) and show the corresponding foreign key name in grid.Show the dropdown value based on the another
 field dropdown selected values in edit mode then we suggest you to use cascading dropdown list. Which helps to show the second dropdown list value based on the first dropdown selected value
